How does your move algorithm work? Describe briefly in English.

First it finds the agent that is unhappy and wants to move. Then
it will call the relocate function which finds the first open spot 
and moves the agent there.

============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?

How straight forward this was compared to the projects I
have done in CS1 and CS2.


============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

I learned how to handle command line arguments and error handling.


What was easy about this assignment?

The basic structure because we did something very similar for homework.

What gave you problems or troubles?

The printing of the grid after I move an agent gave me the most
trouble.

What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?

If I did this wrong then the instructions were unclear but
the teams' happiness was very difficult to understand what it 
was.

What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

There was a lot more work to do than our average homeworks
but it was a pretty easy concept so I'm not sure if I would 
change anything.
